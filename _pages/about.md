<!-- Hi! I am Qinhong Jiang, a PhD candidate and security researcher at Zhejiang University. I work at the [Ubiquitous System Security Laboratory (USSLAB)](http://www.usslab.org/), where I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Chen Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhaLpw8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra). -->

# Qinhong Jiang (蒋沁宏)

A postdoctoral researcher in cyber-physical system (CPS) security and privacy.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [IMCL lab](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html) in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Prof. [Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/).
Prior that, I received my PhD degree from the [Zhejing University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), where I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Chen Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhaLpw8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) at the [Ubiquitous System Security Laboratory (USSLAB)](http://www.usslab.org/).

My research aims to protect the security and privacy of cyber-physical systems and spans the intersections of embedded systems, sensing, and mobile computing. Most of my research focuses on the security and privacy threats of cyber-physical systems caused by vulnerabilities against electromagnetic waves. I am also interested in side-channel attacks, robot system security, machine learning security, large language model security, and anything in security and privacy research that involves signals and physics.

I am open to academic collaborations and welcome discussions concerning potential research partnerships.

<!-- The systems that I have analyzed and/or enhanced include sensors, voice assistants, cyber-physical systems, human-computer interaction devices, surveillance systems, and ubiquitous IoT devices.  -->

<!-- I work towards the next generation of IoT devices and systems that have AI-empowered and science-based security and privacy protections as a fundamental building block. -->

<!-- * [Sep 15, 2025] Our paper <strong>Pha</strong> has been accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). We demonstrate how attackers may eavesdrop on cameras and recover high-quality images in real time by analyzing camera's side-channel EM leakage. Demos will be put up soon! -->
* [Nov 22, 2024] Our paper <strong>GhostShot</strong> has been accepted at [NDSS’25](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). We conducted a schematic analysis of the causality of the IEMI effect on the shapes, brightness, and colors of the injected images, and achieve effective control of the injected pattern through amplitude-phase modulation. ([PDF](), [Demo]())
* [Aug 31, 2024] Our paper <strong>PhantomLiDAR</strong> has been accepted at [NDSS’25](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). We demonstrate how cross-modality signal injection attacks, i.e., IEMI, can manipulate LiDAR output. ([PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17907), [Demo](https://sites.google.com/view/phantomlidar))
* [Aug 5, 2024] I am joining the [IMCL lab](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html) in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University as a postdoctoral fellow, directed by Prof. [Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/).

* [Mar 13, 2024] One paper has been accepted at IEEE Conference on Multimedia Expo 2024 (ICME'24).
* [Nov 26, 2023] One paper has been accepted at IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (IEEE TIFS). ([PDF](hhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10387471), [Demo](https://sites.google.com/view/tsmae))
* [Sep 15, 2023] My co-first authored paper <strong>EM Eye</strong> has been accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/) without revisions. We demonstrate how attackers may eavesdrop on cameras and recover high-quality images in real time by analyzing camera's side-channel EM leakage.

* [Jun 22, 2023] My paper <strong>GhostType</strong> paper has been accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). We uncover a new class of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to induce phantom keystrokes (especially the keys that do not exist on the physical keyboard) into keyboards’ analog circuits in a contactless way using intentional electromagnetic interference.
