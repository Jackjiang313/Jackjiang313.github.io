Hi! I'm Qinhong Jiang, a PhD candidate and security researcher at Zhejiang University. I work at the [Ubiquitous System Security Laboratory (USSLAB)](http://www.usslab.org/), where I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Chen Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhaLpw8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research aims to protect the security and privacy of electronic information systems, with an emphasis on their vulnerabilities against electromagnetic waves. 
Most of my research focuses on conducting intentional electromagnetic injection attacks to disrupt the reliability of electronic information systems and recovering private information from unintentional electromagnetic radiation from these systems.
The systems that I have analyzed and/or enhanced include sensors, voice assistants, cyber-physical systems, human-computer interaction devices, surveillance systems, and ubiquitous IoT devices. 
I work towards the next generation of IoT devices and systems that have AI-empowered and science-based security and privacy protections as a fundamental building block.

* [Sep 15, 2023] My co-first authored EM Eye has been accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/) without revisions. We demonstrate how attackers may visually spy on households by analyzing side-channel EM leakage of smart home cameras owned by the victim. Demos will be put up soon!
* [June 22, 2023] My paper GhostType paper has been conditionally accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). We demonstrate how attackers may visually spy on households by analyzing side-channel EM leakage of smart home cameras owned by the victim. Demos will be put up soon!
