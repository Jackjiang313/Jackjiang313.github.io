Hi! I'm Qinhong Jiang, a PhD candidate and security researcher at Zhejiang University. I work at the [Ubiquitous System Security Laboratory (USSLAB)](http://www.usslab.org/), where I'm honored to be advised by [Prof. Wenyuan Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FCsdj0YAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Xiaoyu Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9D4UYBoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Chen Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhaLpw8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

My research aims to protect the security and privacy of cyber-physical systems, with an emphasis on the information security problems caused by these systems' vulnerabilities against electromagnetic waves. 
Most of my research focuses on <strong>conducting intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) attacks</strong> to disrupt the reliability and integrity of cyber-physical systems and <strong>recovering private information from unintentional electromagnetic (EM) leakage</strong>.
I’m also interested in side channel, covert channel, machine learning security, embedded system security, and anything in security research that involves signals and physics. I'm open to collaborate.
<!-- The systems that I have analyzed and/or enhanced include sensors, voice assistants, cyber-physical systems, human-computer interaction devices, surveillance systems, and ubiquitous IoT devices.  -->

<!-- I work towards the next generation of IoT devices and systems that have AI-empowered and science-based security and privacy protections as a fundamental building block. -->

* [Sep 15, 2023] My co-first authored paper <strong>EM Eye</strong> has been accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/) without revisions. We demonstrate how attackers may eavesdrop on cameras and recover high-quality images in real time by analyzing camera's side-channel EM leakage. Demos will be put up soon!
* [June 22, 2023] My paper <strong>GhostType</strong> paper has been accepted at [NDSS’24](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2024/). We uncover a new class of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to induce phantom keystrokes (especially the keys that do not exist on the physical keyboard) into keyboards’ analog circuits in a contactless way using intentional electromagnetic interference. Demos will be put up soon!
* [July 15, 2022] My paper <strong>GlitchHiker</strong> has been accepted at [USENIX’23](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23). We uncover the vulnerabilities of image signal transmission and demonstrate how attackers may actively induce controlled glitch images of a camera at various positions, widths, and numbers using intentional electromagnetic interference.
* [March 14, 2022] Our survey paper on voice assistant security has been accepted by [ACM Computing Surveys](https://dl.acm.org/journal/csur).
